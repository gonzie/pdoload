# PDOLoad
***PDOLoad*** is a small PDO wrapper to provide read/write endpoints and load balancing capabilities in one line of code.

* Add multiple read and write endpoints
* ***One line implementation***. No need to rewrite your PDO queries.
* Transaction aware. Any reads while a transaction is active will be performed on the write connection.

## Getting started

* PHP >= 7.0 is required
* Install PDOLoad using composer (recommmended) or manually
* Configure your connections and you're ready to go!

## Installing with Composer

```
composer require gonzie/pdoload
```

## How to use

*Documentation will be updated soon.*
